OP was unclear on whether they needed a new connection for each line.
But based on the OP's comment here, I think their need is different than mine. However, 
Google sends people with my need here so here is where I will place this ailternative.

An altercation took place in the Clifton Triangle area of the city just after 02:00 BST after 2am after the three defendants had left a nightclub, the prosecutor said.

The court heard Mr Ali had sustained "significant injuries", including a broken eye socket, after he was attacked.

Mr Corsellis told the jury a bottle was used at the beginning by Mr Ali, and a broken street sign brought into the fray towards the end by Mr Hale.

The defendants had been drinking in Mbargo nightclub, with the alleged incident taking place after it closed at 02:00, jurors heard.

Mr Stokes and his teammate Alex Hales left the nightclub at 00:46 but both returned at 02:08.

Bouncer Andrew Cunningham explained to the pair the club was closed and they would not be allowed in.

However, an "obviously upset" Mr Stokes became "aggressive" and insulted Mr Cunningham about his appearance, jurors heard.

Mr Cunningham said Mr Stokes's attention then turned to two "openly gay" men outside the venue.

He claimed the cricketer had mimicked their voices and mannerisms in what he described as "a derogatory way".

Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol.

The alleged fracas took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at the city's County Ground.
